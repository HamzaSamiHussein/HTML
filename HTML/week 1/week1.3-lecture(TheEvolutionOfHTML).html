    * What is HTML?

    * HTML stands for HyperText Markup Languages

    * Markup Languages are NOT the same as programming Languages
    as we said before that:
    </b>
    Explain:-
    Markup(توصيف أو ترميز): Tags that used to describe our content we create on the document.

    Language: A language that computer system understands and uses to interpret commands

    In easy terms HTML determines the structure and marking up files of
    so the web browsers know how to display your content as a webpages.

    Also, the HTML uses <b>tags</b> to distinguish between 1- what the user
    see and instructions of how to displaying them to the "user".

    <b>
    * In HTML the tags indicate where headings, images, text, line breaks
    and other components should go.
    </b>

    Explain:
    The tags are just containers where we can organize our website so
    if we want to add images we will put them in < img> tags, if we want
    to add multimedia we will add audio or video tags, if we want to
    put ads on our website and put it on the right or left of our website
    we will use aside tags, or we want to use a content that will be
    on the header of the website such as nav bars we will use < header> tag

    <b>
    * .html files
    * When your computer opens a .html file, it knows to open it in an Internet browser (Chrome, Firefox,
    Safari, etc.)
    * The browser can read this file and know how to display it on the screen.
    * Screen readers and other assistive devices can also utilize the HTML tags to present the information is
    special ways.
    </b>
    Explain:
    the browsers knows how to display to an html file that opened by
    your computer

    The screen readers can read those special tags that we use them
    to those who have some accessability issues on our website

   <b> HTML is like english, we can understand the meanings of tags: </b>

    Explain:
    in this image down below
    <img src="Screenshot 2022-02-24 202730.jpg" width="100%">
    we can see that h1 means that is something important and
    h2 is less important and also p tag is the paragraph of the article
    Also, we have a tag were we can add links.

    <b>
    * “Learning” HTML
    </b>
        Explain:
        Latter you will worry more about the semantic not the syntax.
        because semantics is important and you should think how you can use 
        the right tag that relate to your content to enhance the user 
        experience, SEO, and accessability.
        Also, you will thing if someone want to navigate or use the ctrl+F shortcut 
        do they will find what they want on my page.

    * Mosaic 

        Explain:
    * DOM
        Explain: 
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents
            The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScrip
            Every web browser uses some document object model to make web page accessible via JavaScript
